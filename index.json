    "keywords": "Time range queries The Sports Data API supports defining a time range queries via two HTTP query parameters: from - it allows limiting the response by specifying the minimum start date. timeRange - it allows limiting the response by specifying a time range. /events?query=...&from=...&timeRange=... from (query parameter) it allows limiting the response by specifying the minimum start date of the events. For the events and markets collections, this is straightforward and acts as a filter based on the startDate or startEventDate properties. For leagues, regions and sports it will return only items which are referred by events with start date after the one specified here. This option is valid only when used together with timeRange, otherwise it will have no effect. If left empty, from is assumed to be equal to now, i.e. is dynamic and the time range will be considered to be floating. Alternatively, it accepts a value in ISO 8601 format. We also ignore any time granularity below hours (i.e. if you specify a time like 15:35, we will assume it to equal 15:00 // will return leagues from Soccer which have events // starting during the weekend of Sep 23-24, 2017, // assuming we want to display them to a client using CEST. /leagues?query=...&from=2017-09-23T02:00:00Z&timeRange=OneDay timeRange (query parameter) it allows limiting the response by specifying a time range for the start time of the affected events. For the events and markets collections, this is straightforward and acts as a filter based on the startDate or startEventDate properties. For leagues, regions and sports it will return only items which are referred by events with start date within the specified range. This option supports the following values: OneHour, TwoHours, ThreeHours, SixHours, TwelveHours, OneDay, TwoDays, ThreeDays, SevenDays. // will return leagues from Soccer which have events // starting within a range of two days from now. // note that this range is dynamic and the query will update, // dropping some events from the response and adding others, as the time passes. /leagues?query=...&timeRange=SevenDays"

For defining a query the API use OData as a query format (more info about OData supports you can find here). With Pull API you can build complex OData query since it supports operators like: Top, Skip, OrderBy which is not supported in Push API. Any OData query should be URL encoded before being sent.

URL path structure: GET /api/sportsdata/v2/{entity}/?query=...&locale=... Possible entities: events markets selections sports leagues regions Parameters: query (mandatory) - the URL encoded target OData query. Here is a list of supported OData operators: $filter - allows clients to filter a collection of resources that are addressed by a request URL. $top - number of items in the queried collection to be included in the result. $skip - number of items in the queried collection that are to be skipped and not included in the result. $orderBy - allows clients to request resources in either ascending order using asc or descending order using desc. from (optional) timeRange (optional) includeMarkets (optional) - the URL encoded additional OData query to include markets for events ( could be used only for Events endpoint) . locale (optional) - let you specify locale to get translated response. projection (optional) - let you specify what model view to return: onlyId - returns only id compact - is default argument, returns compacted contract details - returns full contract count (optional) - allows to get the number of records for specified $filter: true - returns number of records. $top and $skip will affect on count. false - is default argument, to do not apply count Limitations: $top 100 is max value - the Pull API can't return more than 100 elements in one request. Defaults: if locale is not specified, the API will use \"en\". if $top operator is not specified, the API set 100 if $orderBy operator is not specified, the API applies default order for specific entity (more info about possible order you can find here) . If asc or desc not specified, then the resources will be ordered in ascending order. if projection is not specified, the API will use \"details\" Accepting formats: JSON (application/json) - is a default format which API is using if Accept header is omitted. MsgPack - (application/msgpack) - is an efficient binary serialization format. It's faster and smaller than JSON and we encourage you use it for production purposes.

    "keywords": "Introduction The Sports Data is a push-based queriable API . You compose a query to target a specific data set and the API creates a Subscription and starts sending updates as they happen. For defining a query the API use OData as a query format (more info about OData supports you can find here) . The API supports these protocols: HTTP (for pull, to query data) SSE (for push, to subscribe and listen to a stream of updates, it works over HTTP). Logically the API is divided into two parts: Pull and Push. The Pull API should be used to query data, to retrieve an initial snapshot of data. The Push API should be used to subscribe on a stream of updates by a specific query. The Sports Data API is a way for our clients to build great real-time user experiences, specifically tailored for their needs. The API provides five endpoints returning five types of objects covering different levels of the offer hierarchy: Sports Leagues Events Markets Selections Regions Objects come with a comprehensive amount of attributes describing all of their significant features and parameter. Based on these, you can build a wide range of presentations and experiences. Some examples of features which can be built using the Sports data API include various navigational widgets, league coupons presenting all events from a league, full live betting section, live betting schedule, event view for both pre-match and in-play events, list of upcoming events, optionally grouped by sport, league etc., list of most popular events (ordered by total amount of stakes or total number of bets) and many more. In short, we aim to provide support for any use case which can be part of a complete user-facing sportsbook solution. Usage of Sports Data API is a subject to a contractual agreement between SBTech and a partnering organization. Authentication is required for the API to be used in development and production environments."
